Control Structures in Python
Even/Odd Checker and Sum of Integers Program

This Python program demonstrates the use of control structures through two basic tasks:

Determining whether a number is even or odd using conditional statements

Calculating the sum of integers from 1 to 50 using a for loop

Program Structure and Execution Steps
Task 1: Even or Odd Check
Step 1: Input Collection
Prompts the user to enter a number (num)

Converts the input to an integer using int()

Step 2: Even/Odd Determination
Uses an if-else conditional statement to check whether the number is divisible by 2 using the modulo operator (%)

If num % 2 == 0, it prints that the number is even

Otherwise, it prints that the number is odd

Task 2: Sum of Integers from 1 to 50
Step 1: Loop and Accumulation
Initializes a variable sum to 0

Uses a for loop to iterate from 1 to 50

In each iteration, adds the current number to the sum variable

Step 2: Output
After the loop finishes, prints the final value of sum

Key Features
Demonstrates use of if-else conditional statements

Demonstrates loop structure using for

Clear and formatted output for user understanding

Simple arithmetic and control flow examples for beginners

Notes
Program assumes valid integer input from the user

No input validation or exception handling is implemented

Division or advanced operations are not part of this example
